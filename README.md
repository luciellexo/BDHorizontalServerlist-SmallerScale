# BDHorizontalServerlist-SmallerScale
A edited smaller scale of the Horizontal Server List Theme for Better Discord


Simply put this in your themes folder under C:\Users\*USER*\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes
Under themes in Discord Settings enable it. If this doesnt work you can always copy the code included in the css into custom css and it will work just fine
